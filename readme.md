# JWT Authentication - Spring Boot 3.2.5 Java 17

Foobar is a Python library for dealing with word pluralization.

### Description:
The Spring Boot JWT Authentication Sample project demonstrates how to implement JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication in a Spring Boot application using Java 17. JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties securely. This project provides a robust authentication mechanism where users can obtain a JWT token by providing valid credentials, and subsequently use this token to access protected resources within the application.

### Key Features:

##### User Authentication: Users can authenticate themselves using their credentials (username/password).
##### JWT Generation: Upon successful authentication, a JWT token is generated, containing necessary user information and roles.
##### Token-Based Access: Users can access protected resources by presenting the JWT token with each request.
##### Role-Based Authorization: Authorization checks are performed based on user roles embedded within the JWT token.
##### Token Expiration: JWT tokens have a configurable expiration time, ensuring security and mitigating token misuse.
##### Token Refresh: Users can refresh their JWT token without re-entering their credentials, enhancing user experience and security.
##### Secure Storage: User passwords are securely hashed and stored in the database, enhancing data security.

### Technology Stack:

##### Spring Boot 3.2.5: Provides a powerful platform for building and deploying Java-based applications.
##### Java 17: The latest LTS version of Java, offering new language features, enhanced performance, and improved security.
##### Spring Security: Provides comprehensive security services for Spring-based applications, including authentication and authorization.
##### JWT (JSON Web Tokens): A standard for representing claims securely between two parties, widely used for authentication and information exchange.
##### Spring Data JPA: Simplifies data access layer by providing easy-to-use APIs for working with databases.
##### Hibernate: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework for mapping Java objects to database tables.
#####  MySQL/PostgreSQL/H2 Database: Can choose any of these databases for storing user information and tokens.
